For the STM32 MCU's I did not find support for >16 bit I2S to use in the Arduino environment, so wrote a bare metal bit of code
that takes a set of samples (left plus right) from the ADC and sends it to the DAC.

The IDE used is the very old netbeans 8.2, but this is make file based so can easily be used with other IDE's or just command line build.

All software that I have in mind will be written on bare metal basis. The Arduino environment is only used for quick and simple testing.

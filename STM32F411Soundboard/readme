This board is designed for the STM32F411 based blackpill module.

In the software folder there is an Arduino sketch for testing the MIDI interface in a loop back setup. (MIDI in connected to MIDI out)
I use the Generic STM32F4 series board with under the tools menu the Blackpill F411CE selected for Board part number.
USB support set to "CDC (generic 'Serial' supersede U(S)ART)

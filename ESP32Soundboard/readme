To be able to play with the 8 different ESP32 development boards I have, I designed a carrier board that gives MIDI in and out plus the option to insert audio ADC and DAC modules.

On Aliexpress I found two different PCM5102 DAC modules, which can be used with this carrier board. For the ADC I found only one variant of the PCM1808 module, that fits on this board.

For the audio signals there are two connection options:
1) Mono 6.3mm jack connectors
2) Stereo 3.5mm jack connectors

The MIDI in port is setup with through hole components for easier soldering. I chose for this as MIDI in might be used more than MIDI out. The MIDI out port is setup with SMD components.

To allow for accomodating the 8 different ESP32 development boards the design incorporates several jumpers, that can either be solder type or pin header type.
In the EasyEDApro design there are two versions of the board of which the Normal_Jumpers varient allows for both jumper options. It also has more information on the silkscreen.

In the Hardware directory there is a pdf file that shows the 8 different jumper settings for the different ESP32 boards.

In the Software directory are Arduino sketches with which I tested the hardware. There is one caviat though, the ESP32-WROOM modules need the FLASH voltage eFuses burned.
I used the following command on Linux Mint to do this. "./espefuse set_flash_voltage 3.3V"
See https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/espefuse/set-flash-voltage-cmd.html for more information on this.

To test MIDI the ESP32-S3 and ESP32-S2 need a dedicated MIDI sketch to test the MIDI part. For the other boards I just used serial commands from port 0 to port 1.
On Linux Mint I used the "amidi" command to send and receive midi.


To list the available devices use: "amidi -l"
To receive data use:               "amidi -d -p hw:1,0,0"
To send data use                   "amidi -s "rom1a.syx" -p hw:1,0,0"

The above commands assume hw:1,0,0 to be the available device.
